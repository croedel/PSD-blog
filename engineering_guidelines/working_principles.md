# Working Principles

## Working together as a team

We fundamentally believe in the power of working together as a team - not just as a work group. A well performing team is much more than the sum of its individual team members. It can deliver outstanding, superior results.

The bases for getting a real team consists of:

* **Trust**: Give and gain trust. Be vulnerable, be open.
* **Open discussions**: Nurture constructive passionate debates.
* **Commitment**: Commit on clear goals.
* **Accountability**: Be accountable. Set high standards for you and others.
* **Focus on results**: Focus on team success.


More about this can be found in the book [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team) by Patrick Lencioni.

## Code of conduct

Derived from these pillars, we follow this code of conduct

* **Disagree and commit**
    We commit to team's decisions, even if we disagree.
* **Company > team > individual**
    We put company over team over individual.
* **Give an take feedback**
    We give prompt feedback and proactively speak up to surface conflict. We don’t bad mouth each other.
* **Help each other**
    We ask for help when we need it, and are active in providing support to each other.
* **Challenge your peers**
    We are not afraid to go out of our own areas and challenge each other courageously.
* **Respect other people's time and contribution**
    We respect each other’s time and contribution, we listen actively to understand each other’s needs & check our egos at the door.
* **Learn constantly**
    We identify learning edges and work on them proactively.
* **Communicate**
    We over communicate – we transfer information to the right person and don’t engage in water cooler talk.
* **Learn from failures**
    We learn from our failure and celebrate success. We don't blame others for failures.
* **Take calculated risks**
    We are not afraid and take calculated risks.
* **Solution mindset**
    We adopt a solution mindset, and don’t adopt a blame or victim mindset.

## Agile Methodology

We believe in an [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) software development methodology that allows engineers to get work done while management gets out of the way.

We give teams Autonomy to leverage intrinsic motivation and work hard, to build great software that they can be proud of. Teams move in parallel making the big decisions needed to create great products, without having to ask permission for everything.

Having a defined, clear Purpose gives our teams, as well as the entire organization, a point of focus. It allows us to be disciplined in how we think, to communicate broadly and concisely, to make the indicators for progress visible, and to focus as a group on the hard challenges ahead. Purpose inspires our engineers to understand the why behind the products that we’re building, on top of measuring its success.

## Autonomous teams

We strongly believe in cross-functional, agile, autonomous teams who take full responsibility of end-to-end delivery (idea to production) of their code and services.

A team needs to cover all regularly required skills they need. This may include e.g. frontend development, backend development, test automization, operations, ...   

### Agile > Process

Don’t focus too much on the process, focus on the outcome!

We don't care which agile collaboration process (Scrum, Kanban etc.) you follow within your team. Choose one which fits best to your team and your challenges.

Never the less, we expect teams to comply to following rules:

* Align on a global 2 weeks "sprint clock", which ticks over every 2nd Wednesday, committing to providing each other major deliverables by that date
* Teams are expected to make their delivery status fully transparent in Jira
    
### Service KPI's

Each team shall define and measure appropriate KPI's for their services. They shall cover the most relevant aspects of a service. Usually this are:

* Availability: monthly service availability
* Performance: response times (average, 95% percentile, ...)
* Costs: hosting, traffic, ...
* Errors / crashes: error-rate, crash-rate, ...
